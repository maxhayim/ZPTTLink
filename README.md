# ZPTTLink
ZPTTLink is an open-source, cross-platform utility that connects Zello (running inside BlueStacks) to radio gateway hardware like the AIOC (All-In-One Cable). It enables seamless Push-to-Talk (PTT) control and audio routing between your computer and radio, creating a functional bridge between digital voice and RF communication.
