# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.  
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information (such as a physical or email address) without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution
